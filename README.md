### CURL POWER SURVEY

This is a survey app. It allows you to take surveys other users have made as well as create your own true and false question survey. It works by storing the surveys on a database and then later allows for those surveys to be displayed for others to take.

The front end uses express.js, javaScript, AJAX, Mongoose and Handlebars.

One the the unsolved problems we would like to solve is how to do a dependent destroy of the child schema with the parent.

When we started the project the first step our group would take before writing any code was to write or draw out what had to be done. We would walk through the feature we wanted to tackle a that time and plan step by step what we would do. We did most of the project by displaying on computer on a screen and all working on the same feature together. When we would run into a problem we would all go over what we wanted to achieve and out ideas on how to achieve it. We would also diagram out what we wanted to try before we continued with actual code.
